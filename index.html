        <h1>Computer Intelligence Project</h1>
        <p>
            The Computer Intelligence Project builds on the <a href="https://www.bigcode-project.org/"><u>BigCode Project</u></a>, developing open models, datasets, and evaluation tools for computer-level code intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ultimate goal of code intelligence is to automate computer-level tasks via executable programs.
            These computer-level tasks are typically based on graphic user interfaces (GUIs) that rendered by software applications,
            which means that the model will not only rely on textual information,
            but also understand the visual context from human perception.
            However, current multimodal models are far from perfect to design and interact with these visual context.
            Plus, there is limited data that can be used to train such models.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we aim to develop a new generation of code intelligence -- <b>Computer Intelligence</b>,
            that can fully utilize the computer-level visual information to perform complex and practical tasks.
            Particularly, we focus on three parts: Web Page, Data Science, and Full Stack.
            The expected outcome will be open models, datasets, and evaluation tools.
