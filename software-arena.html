        <h1>Software Arena</h1>
        <p>
            Software Arena extends Chatbot Arena with powerful code execution capabilities, enabling evaluation of LLM-generated programs across a wide range of outputs - from simple computations to complex visual interfaces.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Software Arena?</h2>
        <p>
            Software Arena introduces a plug-and-play code execution environment for Chatbot Arena. It enables direct evaluation of LLM capabilities in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>General-purpose code execution across multiple languages</li>
            <li>Output visualization ranging from text, images, to interactive UIs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Software Arena?</h2>
        <p>
            Software Arena is designed to address the limitations of Chatbot Arena, particularly in terms of precise code evaluation.
            Human judgement on code generation is not always reliable [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11296"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03837"><u>2</u></a>], and generally requires non-trivial knowledge of the language and its libraries.
            We consider this a significant limitation for the development of advanced AI systems.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            There are several concurrent features and projects that explore the capabilities of LLMs designing complex programs with execution.
            <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them"><u>Claude Artifacts</u></a> by Anthropic is one of the first features in this space to let users interact with LLM-generated frontend applications.
            <a href="https://v0.dev/"><u>v0</u></a> by Vercel also allows users to ship LLM-generated frontend applications with frontend frameworks.
            Based on this, <a href="https://chatbotarena.ai/webdev"><u>WebDev Arena</u></a> by Chatbot Arena and <a href="https://www.llmcodearena.com/"><u>Code Arena</u></a> by Together AI focus on evaluating LLM-generated frontend applications.
            <u>Software Arena aims to extend this capability to a wider range of outputs, not just frontend applications, but also programs that can be run on backend servers and data analysis.</u> 
        </p>
        <h2>Supported Outputs</h2>
        <p>Software Arena can visualize various types of code execution outputs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Documents (Markdown or Plain Text)</li>
            <li>Websites (single webpage)</li>
            <li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images</li>
            <li>Plots</li>
            <li>Tables</li>
            <li>Interactive React/Vue components</li>
            <li>Gradio applications</li>
            <li>Streamlit applications</li>
            <li>PyGame</li>
            <li>Mermaid diagrams</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            Software Arena builds upon FastChat, the foundation of Chatbot Arena, providing seamless code execution capabilities. The implementation focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Execution:</strong> Secure, sandboxed environment using <a href="https://e2b.dev/"><u>E2B</u></a> for executing code in supported language (Python, JavaScript, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Automatic installation of various dependencies via NPM and PIP (backed by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv"><u>UV</u></a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Code Editing:</strong> On-the-fly code modification, testing, and re-execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Tracking:</strong> Comprehensive logging of user interactions on the rendered UI.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            Software Arena aims to deliver several key outcomes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> A dynamic Elo rating system tracking LLM performance in execution-based code generation, providing transparent comparisons across different models.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Preference Data:</strong> Collection of high-quality human feedback on code outputs, creating a valuable dataset for improving code-generation capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactions and Trajectories:</strong> Comprehensive logs of human-AI interactions during code development and user trajectories on the rendered GUI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            Software Arena is currently in the early stage of development.
            We plan to continuously add more features towards the goal of Computer Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, we are actively working with <a href="https://lmarena.ai/"><u>Chatbot Arena</u></a> to integrate Software Arena into their platform.
